This project tracks the growth of a population of rabbits, with two basic components: the sensor, and the backend.
The sensor samples the number of deaths and births of rabbits. And the backend analyzes the data from the sensor and
updates the number of currently alive rabbits.

The module 'sensor' has the attributes and functionality of creating and adding new records to the json file
'records.json'.

The module 'backend' has the attributes and functionality of reading from the json file each time 10 new records
get added by the sensor, and updating the number of alive rabbits according to the births and deaths of each record,
discarding records with invalid input.

The module 'record_tracker' has the class 'Tracker' which tracks the records being added and everytime 10 new records
accumulate, it indicates that and starts counting from zero again for the next 10.

The '__main__' function runs the sensor and backend consecutively.

The points of failure could happen when exceptions get raised when reading or writing to json file, and that is why
for every exception possible there is a function that deals with it according to the type of error.

The directory 'tests' includes all the test files for each module individually, and for different types of inputs.
