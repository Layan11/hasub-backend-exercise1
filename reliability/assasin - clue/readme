This is a game of clue, to run it please run the __main__ module.

The text files: 'places' and 'weapons' contain all the different places that exist in the game,
and the different weapons, respectively. If you would like to add more places or weapons or change their names
you can edit those text files and the code would still work correctly.

The module player contains a class of the player with all its needed attributes.

The module game contains the game class which has all of the moves and functionalities of the game.

The number of players is given by the user input.

The code could fall if the user input isn't valid, so i used try/except block to deal with that.
